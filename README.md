I love to engance my knowledge and try new things everyday, I love computers, It is my life and only thing that i have now. Two years ago, I lost myself in the light of computers. Love computer systems and applications and finding new ways to enhance my skills.

For now, I am learning and crating new things which gives me the satisfaction to sleep at night...
