## About me
- Development is the path of continuous Learning, we can never satisfy from our knowledge. our knowledge is worth only when we can create something. 
- There is no perfect way, perfect answer, perfect life **and No Perfect Code**.
- Communication is the key, make friends and develop your skills.

For now, I am learning and crating new things which gives me the satisfaction.
